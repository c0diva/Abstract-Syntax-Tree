# Abstract-Syntax-Tree
Code Parser with Abstract Syntax Tree

Code analysis consists of extracting lexical content from source code files, analyzing the code's syntax from its lexical content, and building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that holds the results of our analysis. It is then fairly easy to build several backends that can do further analyses on the AST to construct code metrics, search for particular constructs, or some other interesting features of the code.
